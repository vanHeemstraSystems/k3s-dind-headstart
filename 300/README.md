# 300 - What would I use it for?

k3s-dind is awesome for:

- Quickly running automated unit tests in Kubernetes
- Running your containerized app locally for easier debugging
- Testing out automation or changes to a Kubernetes cluster
- Ensuring you're starting with a fresh cluster every time
- Doing all that stuff in only 512MB of RAM!
